# STACK SKILLS INDEX - DanangTrip Web

Master index for the 10 local skills in `.agent/skills/`.
Use this file to decide which skill to activate, what context must be read first, and what artifact each step should produce.

## Goals

- Stay aligned with the real `danangtrip-web` repository.
- Keep one execution model across Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, and manual runs.
- Produce reusable project artifacts, not one-off answers.
- Prevent template drift by checking repo reality before following a skill.

## Canonical Read Order

Before non-trivial work, read in this order:

1. `.agent/rules/PROJECT_RULES.md`
2. `.agent/rules/REPO_FACTS.md`
3. `.agent/memory/WORKING_STATE.md`
4. `.agent/memory/HANDOFF.md`
5. Relevant recent files in `.agent/memory/decisions/` and `.agent/artifacts/`
6. Real repo sources: `package.json`, `src/`, `next.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `scripts/`
7. The specific `SKILL.md` that matches the task

If these sources conflict, follow the earlier item in the list.

## How To Run Skills

### Preferred

Use the platform adapter already installed at the repo root:

- `AGENTS.md` for the shared operating contract
- `.claude/commands/` for Claude-style entry points
- `.gemini/commands/` for Gemini-style entry points
- `.opencode/skills` for OpenCode skill discovery

In this mode, the adapter should route back to `.agent/` and keep working memory and artifacts current.

### Fallback

If the platform cannot use the root adapters, manually activate the skill by:

1. Reading the canonical read order above
2. Opening the target skill folder
3. Supplying the required context fields shown in this file
4. Writing the output artifact to `.agent/artifacts/...`
5. Updating `WORKING_STATE.md` or `HANDOFF.md` if task state changed

Do not treat manual prompt injection as the primary mode anymore. It is only the fallback mode.

## Full Pipeline Approval Prompt

Use this prompt when you want the AI to execute the entire local pipeline from start to finish, but only one approved step at a time.
This is the strictest execution mode and is the recommended choice for large feature work.

```text
SYSTEM EXECUTION CONTRACT

Act as the execution agent for repository: `[REPO_PATH]`

Your job is to run the local `.agent` pipeline step by step, with strict user approval gates.
You MUST NOT skip, merge, reorder, or auto-complete any step unless I explicitly approve the current step and tell you to continue.

MANDATORY READ ORDER BEFORE ANY WORK
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `.agent/rules/PROJECT_RULES.md`
3. `.agent/rules/REPO_FACTS.md`
4. `.agent/memory/WORKING_STATE.md`
5. `.agent/memory/HANDOFF.md`
6. relevant recent files in `.agent/memory/decisions/` and `.agent/artifacts/`
7. `.agent/skills/STACK_SKILLS_INDEX.md`
8. the current step's `SKILL.md`

GLOBAL RULES
- You MUST follow the local `.agent` system only.
- You MUST treat `.agent` as the single source of truth.
- You MUST execute all steps in order.
- You MUST NOT skip any step.
- You MUST NOT combine multiple steps into one response.
- You MUST stop after each step and wait for my approval.
- You MUST update `.agent/memory/WORKING_STATE.md` when the active task state changes.
- You MUST update `.agent/memory/HANDOFF.md` if work is paused or blocked.
- You MUST create or update the required artifact for each step under `.agent/artifacts/`.
- If repo reality conflicts with a template, follow repo reality and record the mismatch in the artifact.
- If information is missing, state the missing input inside the current step output, but do NOT jump ahead.

APPROVAL GATE
After finishing each step, STOP and wait.
Only continue when I reply with one of:
- `duyệt`
- `ok bước này`
- `tiếp tục`
- `next`

If I give feedback, revise the SAME current step first.
Do not start the next step until I explicitly approve.

PIPELINE ORDER
Execute in this exact order:

1. `01-screen-analysis`
2. `02-project-setup`
3. `03-types-api-contract`
4. `04-layout-routing`
5. `05-ui-components`
6. `06-data-integration`
7. `07-interactions`
8. `08-auth-permissions`
9. `09-testing`
10. `10-optimization-deploy`

STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION RULE
For each step:
1. Read the step's `SKILL.md`
2. Restate the goal of the step in repository terms
3. List required inputs for that step
4. Perform only that step
5. Produce or update the step artifact
6. Report exactly what was done
7. Report what is still unknown or risky
8. STOP for approval

```

## Artifact Standard

Artifact naming:

```text
.agent/artifacts/<group>/YYYY-MM-DD__<feature-slug>__<artifact-name>.md
```

Artifact quality rules:

- UTF-8
- One `#` H1 only
- Include feature slug, date, and sources used
- Mark uncertainty with `[ASSUMPTION]`
- No broken encoding or placeholder junk

A good artifact answers:

- What feature or task is being worked on?
- Which sources were used?
- Which files are affected?
- Which technical or business rules apply?
- What risks, blockers, or open questions remain?

Final-phase artifacts such as `test-report`, `deploy-report`, and `review.md` must also include:

- clear verdict
- concrete evidence
- `not run`, `skipped`, or `pending` sections when needed
- next actions or residual risks

## Repository Reality

| Area | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Next.js App Router |
| React | 19.x |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Data fetching | TanStack Query v5 |
| State | Zustand v5 |
| Validation | Zod v4 |
| HTTP | Axios v1 |
| i18n | next-intl v4 |
| Forms | Mixed today; follow touched-feature reality |
| Testing | Vitest v4 |
| Deploy | Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext |

Form note:

- Check `.agent/rules/REPO_FACTS.md` before assuming a form pattern.
- If a touched feature already uses local state plus `safeParse`, stay with that unless the task is an explicit migration.

## Pipeline Map

| # | Skill | Use When | Primary Artifact | Can Skip When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | `01-screen-analysis` | New screen, flow, Figma, or requirement analysis | `analysis/...__screen-analysis.md` | Tiny bug fix with no UI or flow change |
| 02 | `02-project-setup` | Base audit, config check, stack drift, runtime readiness | `setup/...__project-setup-report.md` | Recent audit still reflects current repo state |
| 03 | `03-types-api-contract` | New or changed types, schemas, service contracts | `api-contracts/...__api-contract.md` | Pure copy or style change with no data impact |
| 04 | `04-layout-routing` | New routes, page structure, metadata, i18n route concerns | `routing/...__route-plan.md` | Only editing a child component inside an existing page |
| 05 | `05-ui-components` | New UI build or component refactor | `ui-specs/...__ui-spec.md` | Logic-only change with no UI structure impact |
| 06 | `06-data-integration` | Wiring API and query flows into UI | `integration/...__data-integration.md` | Static UI or tiny server-only change |
| 07 | `07-interactions` | Forms, filters, search, pagination, mutations | `interaction-specs/...__interaction-spec.md` | Read-only page with no meaningful interaction |
| 08 | `08-auth-permissions` | Auth, route protection, gated UI, role-based behavior | `auth/...__auth-permissions-review.md` | Fully public feature with no permission change |
| 09 | `09-testing` | Validation before handoff | `test-cases/...__test-report.md` | Should not be skipped |
| 10 | `10-optimization-deploy` | Final readiness, handoff, push, deploy | `deploy/...__deploy-report.md`, `review/...__review.md` | Should not be skipped |
